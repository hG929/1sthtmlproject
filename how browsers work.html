        <ol>
            <li>A browsers takes the link (or URL) and 
                send it to another online service called 
                the DNS (Domain Name System)</li>
            <li>A DNS takes a URL and transfer it to a IP 
                address, like google.com to 113.245.123.11
                 (numbers between 1 and 255)</li>
            <li>An IP address of a URL is the address of 
                the web server that stores the web content 
                of the web page.</li>
            <li>A web server's jobs is to send and 
                receive data to and from the browser</li>
            <li>The browser takes data from a web server 
                and build a web page for people to read.</li>
        </ol>
